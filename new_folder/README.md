# PCA for Customer Segmentation in Retail
**What is PCA?**<br>
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method used to transform data into a set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) components. These components are called principal components. The goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much variability (information) as possible.
<br>How Does PCA Work?<br>
**Standardize the Data:**<br>
PCA is sensitive to the scale of the data. Standardizing the data (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) ensures that each feature contributes equally to the analysis.<br>

**Compute the Covariance Matrix:**<br>
The covariance matrix captures the relationships between different features in the data.<br>

**Perform Eigen Decomposition:**<br>
Eigen decomposition is used to extract the principal components from the covariance matrix.<br>
Components:<br>
Eigenvalues: Indicate the amount of variance captured by each principal component.<br>
Eigenvectors: Represent the directions of the principal components.<br>

**Select Principal Components:**<br>
Choose a subset of principal components that capture the most variance in the data. Typically, you select components that explain a high percentage of the total variance.<br>
Decision: Based on eigenvalues, select the top ùëò principal components.<br>
**Transform the Data:**<br> Purpose: Project the original data onto the selected principal components to obtain a lower-dimensional representation.<br>

**Problem Statement:**<br>
<br>A retail company wants to segment its customers based on their purchasing behavior to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.<br>

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**<br>

**Collect Customer Data:**<br>
Gather data on customers' purchasing behavior, including features such as the number of purchases, average purchase value, frequency of purchases, and total spending.<br>

**Standardize the Data:**<br>
Standardize the features to ensure each feature contributes equally to the analysis.<br>

**Compute the Covariance Matrix:**<br>
Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized features to understand the relationships between different customer behaviors.<br>

**Perform Eigen Decomposition:**<br>
Perform eigen decomposition on the covariance matrix to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvectors represent the principal components of the customer behavior data.<br>

**Select Principal Components:**<br>
Choose the top
ùëò
k principal components that capture most of the variance in the customer behavior data.<br>

**Transform the Original Data:**<br>
Project the original high-dimensional customer behavior data onto the selected principal components to obtain a lower-dimensional representation.<br>

**Cluster Customers:**<br>
Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) on the lower-dimensional data to segment customers into distinct groups.<br>

**PCA Plot:**<br>

The scatter plot shows the customers in the new space defined by the first two principal components.<br>
Each point represents a customer, and the axes represent the principal components.<br>
Customers that are close to each other in this plot have similar purchasing behaviors.<br>
**Interpretation:**<br>
**Customer Clustering:** The plot can be used to visually identify clusters of customers with similar purchasing behaviors.<br>
**Tailored Marketing:** The company can use these clusters to tailor marketing strategies for different segments. For example, customers in one cluster may prefer discounts, while another cluster may respond better to loyalty programs.
<br>**Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA helps reduce the complexity of the data while retaining most of the important information, making it easier to analyze and interpret customer behavior.
<br>This example demonstrates how PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of customer data, making it easier to identify patterns and segment customers for targeted marketing strategies.
